Read WAMIT output files
=======================

This repository contains scripts to read output data from the panel method code [WAMIT](http://www.wamit.com/). The objective is to visualize the data for comparing different runs and to store the data for later use in time domain simulations tools like [WEC-Sim](http://wec-sim.github.io/WEC-Sim/). So the focus is on the hydrostatic restoring, added mass and damping coefficients that WAMIT writes to the output file *.out.

Check out this [iPython Notebook](https://wakari.io/sharing/bundle/barahona/readWAMIT) the get a feel for this script.
